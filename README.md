I'm a PhD student based in Perpignan (France) working on temporal trends and resilience of coral reefs. Most of my research projetcs are based on the [Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network](https://gcrmn.net/) (GCRMN), which is a global network of people involved in coral reef monitoring, that aims to provide the best information available about coral reef status and trends.
