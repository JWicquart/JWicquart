### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student based in Perpignan (France) working on temporal trends and resilience of coral reefs. Most of my research projetcs are based on the [Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network](https://gcrmn.net/) (GCRMN), which is a global network of people involved in coral reef monitoring, that aims to provide the best information available about coral reef status and trends. I'm mostly interested by data analysis, macroecology, temporal ecology and community ecology.
